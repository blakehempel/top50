    q-factor Model
    We construct  the q-factors from a triple 2-by-3-by-3 sort on size, I/A, and ROE.


    Investment Factor is investment-to-assets, I/A, as the annual change in total assets divided by 1-year-lagged total assets.
    3 GROUPS: 30% Low, 40% Middle, 30% High
    Independently, at the end of June of year t, we break all stocks into 3 I/A groups, 
    using the NYSE breakpoints for the low 30%, middle 40%, and high 30% of the 
    ranked values of I/A for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t âˆ’1.


    Profitability Factor as ROE, is income before extraordinary items divided by 1-quarter-lagged book equity.
    3 GROUPS: 30% Low, 40% Middle, 30% High
    In addition, independently, at the beginning of each month, we sort all
    stocks into 3 groups based on the NYSE breakpoints for the low 30%, middle
    40%, and high 30% of the ranked values of ROE


    Size factor, at the end of June of each year t, we use [market cap] to split stocks into 2 groups, 
    small and big. 
    2 GROUPS: 50% SMALL, 50% BIG
    The size factor, rME, is the difference (small-minus-big), each month, 
    between the simple average of the returns on the 9 small size portfolios 
    and the simple average of the returns on the 9 big size portfolios.

    Taking the intersections of the 2 size, 3 I/A, and 3 ROE groups, we form 18 portfolios.

    Monthly value-weighted portfolio returns are calculated for the current month, 
    and the portfolios are rebalanced monthly. (The ROE portfolios are rebalanced monthly 
    at the beginning of each month, and the size and I/A portfolios are rebalanced annually 
    at the end of each June.)
